# Compiler-C-to-8086-assembly

This project was part of compiler sessional course in level 3 term 1. A program written in subset of 
C language is taken as input and 8086 assembly instruction is genereted as output which can later
run on emu8086 assembler.

This project was completed in 4 part. I had to submit each part and get evaluated before I start the 
next one. So that's why there is 4 folder. Each part has there on specification, testcases and build
instructions. Details reside in their respective folders.
